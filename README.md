Netflix Clone using React
Website : https://netflix-clone-u-react.netlify.app

This is a Netflix clone website created using react. TMDB API is used to fetch all information regarding movies like backdrop-path, movie poster, movie overview,etc

It includes various sections like at top it has Banner section, and various rows like Netflix Originals, Trending Now, Top Rated, Action Movies, Comedy Movies, Horror Movies, Romance Movies and Documentaries Movies.

It has an additional function that is, when an individual movie banner or movie poster is clicked, it opens up a trailer of that video below that row. I have used a movie-trailer npm package that fetches the trailer of that movie from youtube.
